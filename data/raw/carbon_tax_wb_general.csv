It covers large emitting facilities, with the ability for lower emitting facilities to opt in to the regulation. 
 
Covered entities must reduce their emissions intensity (emissions per unit of production) by a set percentage each year. The reduction requirement is based on a facility’s average emissions intensity over a three-year historic period or compared to a sector-specific benchmark. Covered entities that outperform their targets generate emissions performance credits (EPCs), which can be sold or used in future compliance years. Those that exceed their limits are required to provide compensation by either (1) purchasing EPCs from other covered facilities, (2) paying into the TIER fund to purchase a fund credit for each tonne of excess emissions, or (3) purchasing emission offset credits generated within Alberta under an approved offset protocol or sequestration credits. ","Alberta’s Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) Regulation was amended in December 2022, with changes taking effect on January 1, 2023. Updates included setting the carbon price in line with the federal benchmark; tightening output-based benchmarks by 2% annually from 2023 to 2030 and also increasing the tightening rates of the oil sands sectors by 4% in 2029 and 2030; reducing the opt-in threshold to 2,000 tonne  per year; increasing the limits on emission performance and offsets usage from 60% in 2023 by 10% annually until it reaches 90% in 2026; reducing the credit expiry to five years; establishing sequestration credits and capture recognition tonnes  to support carbon capture, utilization, and storage investments; and changing the biomass emissions treatment to support bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.
","Alberta’s TIER Regulation applies to all greenhouse gas emissions from facilities that emit 100 ktCO2-e/year or more, including industry, power, food processing, waste and other sectors. Smaller conventional oil and gas facilities can aggregate and opt-in to the regulation. Lower emitting facilities (those emitting 2,000 tonnes CO2e or more per year) can opt-in to the regulation.

Facility-level baselines are calculated using output-based benchmarking based on emissions intensity.  
 
Facilities emitting above their baseline must offset excess emissions by surrendering Safeguard Mechanism Credits (SMCs) or Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs). In some cases, facilities can also apply to average their emissions over a longer period or borrow from a future year.  
 
The Safeguard Mechanism was introduced in 2016 but had not been classified as a baseline-and-credit system as no tradeable permits were issued. However, as of July 2023, the government issues SMCs to facilities that over-achieve on their baseline. This reform was accompanied by a tightening of baselines and a default decline rate of 4.9% per year, to align the outcome with Australia’s 2030 targets.
","Legislation to reform the Safeguard Mechanism was passed in March 2023, with changes entering into force from July 2023. The Safeguard Mechanism now assigns emissions baselines to over 200 large facilities, with those emitting above their baseline required to offset excess emissions. The reforms tightened emissions baselines for covered facilities and now allow the issuance of credits to facilities that overachieve on their baseline. This in effect turned the Safeguard Mechanism into a baseline-and-credit system. 
","The Safeguard Mechanism covers all direct (scope 1) GHG emissions from facilities emitting over 100kt CO2-e/year in electricity, mining, oil and gas production, manufacturing, transport and waste.

Although the NEHG does not establish a carbon tax, the carbon pricing instrument follows in central parts the logic of existing energy taxes (fuel tax, coal tax, and natural gas tax). Thus, if a certain event is taxable under the existing energy taxes regime, an obligation to buy allowances arises under the NEHG. Taxable events are the production, import, or release of energy products from a tax warehouse in Austria or the supply of coal and natural gas to consumers. In practice, only a limited number of energy distributors and oil companies are subject to the NEHG 2022.
 
The NEHG aims to cover emissions outside the EU ETS, encompassing predominantly emissions in the buildings and transport sectors. Between 2022 and 2025, the system will operate with an annually increasing fixed price and a flexible cap, such that more allowances will be available for entities if needed. The NEHG is being phased in gradually. The system has been designed in line with the reduction targets for non-EU ETS sectors as defined by the “European Effort Sharing Regulation” (ESR). The system may eventually transfer into the EU ETS 2. ","In 2023, the NEHG successfully completed its inaugural year. Covered entities began surrendering national emission allowances on a quarterly basis, beginning in March.  ","The Austria ETS applies to fossil fuels used in the transport, buildings, agriculture, and energy sectors, as well as from small industries. This essentially concerns the following fossil energy sources: petrol, gasoil (diesel), heating oil, natural gas, liquefied gas, coal, and kerosene. Fuels in admixture with biogenic fuels receive a lower emissions factor than purely fossil fuels. ENtities that would be liable for less than 1 tonne of CO2e per year are excluded.

The approach requires all Canadian provinces and territories to have a carbon pricing system in place that aligns with the federal standard. A federal carbon pricing backstop system comes into effect, in whole or in part in any province or territory that requested it or that does not have a price on carbon in place that meets the federal standard. The federal backstop system consists of two components: a regulatory charge on fuels, and a baseline-and-credit ETS for emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industrial facilities called the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS).

To comply with the national system, provinces need to implement systems that meet the minimum national carbon price. The minimum national carbon price was set at CAD 65 (USD 48.15) in 2023, increasing by CAD 15 (USD 11.11) each year to reach CAD 170 (USD 125.93) in 2030.  As cap-and-trade systems set maximum emissions levels rather than minimum carbon prices, for these systems the minimum carbon pollution price is translated into an equivalent cap on emissions.","All Canadian provinces and territories had until September 2022 to either request the federal carbon pollution pricing system or propose their own plan for a carbon pricing system for 2023 to 2030 that meets the updated benchmark criteria.  As of the beginning of 2024, the federal OBPS applies in Manitoba, Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, and Yukon.

The rates are now set to decline at a fixed tightening rate with no end date: 2% annual tightening rate for most industrial facilities’ output-based standards and 1% for high-risk EITE facilities.

It covers around 70% of the state’s emissions, and its cap trajectory is consistent with the long-term target to reduce statewide emissions to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. 
 
The program covers around 150 entities in the energy, industrial, buildings, and transport sectors. Many of the cap-and-invest program’s design elements are similar to those of California’s cap-and-trade program.  Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions. Allowances are distributed through auctioning and free allocation, with the latter based primarily on benchmarking. 
 
The cap-and-invest program was established by the “Climate Commitment Act” (CCA), signed into law by Governor Jay Inslee in May 2021. ","In March 2024, the governments of California, Quebec and Washington issued a joint statement on potential market linkage. Governor Inslee signed into law a bill that modified the CCA to facilitate future linkage, with the modifications taking effect on 1 January 2025.

However, in November 2023, the Department of Ecology announced that it would pursue linkage with the cap-and-trade programs of California and Québec. If implemented, linkage is not expected to come into effect until at least 2025. "

The carbon tax rate was set at MXN 250 per tCO2e. The carbon tax applies to fixed sources and facilities. 
If regulated entities can prove an emissions reduction of at least 20% compared to the previous fiscal year, the tax payable in the following fiscal year will be reduced by 20%. 
Revenues are used for different purposes, mainly on environmental, sustainable development, and economic programs, and climate change mitigation and adaptation programs.

It covers substances generated in production and services processes within the State.
The tax applies to any natural and legal person with fixed sources of emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride).
Emissions must be directly measured or estimated. Entities may use the federal Registry on Emissions and Pollution Transfers (Registro de Emisiones y Transferencias de Contaminantes, RETC) for this. ",Set price,Monthly,
